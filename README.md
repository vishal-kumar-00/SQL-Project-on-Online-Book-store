# SQL-Project-on-Online-Book-store

 Project Summary: 
 
 Online Bookstore Database

Books â€“ stores book details (title, author, genre, price, stock, etc.)

Customers â€“ stores customer information (name, email, city, country, etc.)

Data Import: CSV files are used to populate each table with initial data.

ðŸ“Š Query Features
Basic Queries:

Retrieve books by genre or publication year

Filter customers by country

Get orders within specific dates or above a certain value

Advanced Queries:

Aggregate book sales by genre and author

Identify high-spending customers and popular books

Calculate total revenue

Track inventory remaining after orders

Analyze customer behavior (e.g., repeat buyers)

âœ… Key Learnings & Highlights
Use of foreign key relationships to connect tables

Application of aggregations, joins, and grouping

Filtering with date ranges, text matching, and numeric comparisons

Importance of data normalization and query optimization (e.g., indexing, using ILIKE, avoiding insert into SERIAL IDs)
